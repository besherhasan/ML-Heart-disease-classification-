Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning
This repository contains a notebook that explores the use of various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries to build a machine learning model for predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

Approach
Problem Definition:
In a statement, the project aims to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on clinical parameters.

Data:
The original data is sourced from the Cleveland dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. There is also a version available on Kaggle.

Evaluation:
The project will be considered successful if it achieves at least 90% accuracy in predicting the presence or absence of heart disease during the proof of concept.

Features:
The dataset includes various features, such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, thalassemia, and the predicted attribute.

Installation
To set up the required dependencies, you can run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Source
You can download the dataset from the following links:

UCI Machine Learning Repository
Kaggle
Methodology
The project follows the typical data science process:

Data Preprocessing: Import necessary libraries and read the data using Pandas.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore the data, including visualizations of the review scores and their distribution.
Modeling: Build machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the models using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC score.
Feature Importance: Determine which features contributed most to the model's predictions.
Cross-Validation: Calculate classification metrics using n-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
Experimentation: Experiment with new data samples to predict whether a patient has heart disease.
Usage
You can run the project in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Follow the code in the notebook to understand the sentiment analysis process using different machine learning models.

Feature Importance
The project analyzes feature importance for the Logistic Regression model. Features are weighted based on their contribution to the model's predictions.

Prediction Example
You can experiment with the model by providing patient information as a dictionary and using the trained model for predictions. The model will predict whether the patient has heart disease.

python
Copy code
patient1 = {
    'age': [45],
    'sex': [1],  # 1 for male, 0 for female
    'cp': [2],   # Chest pain type
    'trestbps': [120],  # Resting blood pressure
    'chol': [200],  # Serum cholesterol
    'fbs': [0],  # Fasting blood sugar (0 or 1)
    'restecg': [0],  # Resting electrocardiographic results
    'thalach': [150],  # Maximum heart rate achieved
    'exang': [0],  # Exercise-induced angina (0 or 1)
    'oldpeak': [0.6],  # ST depression induced by exercise
    'slope': [1],  # Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
    'ca': [0],  # Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
    'thal': [2]  # Thalassemia
}

# Use the trained model to make a prediction
model = gs_log_reg  # Replace with your trained model
prediction1 = model.predict(Patient1_df)

if prediction1[0] == 1:
    print("The model predicts that the patient has heart disease.")
else:
    print("The model predicts that the patient does not have heart disease.")
Feel free to experiment with different patient data to make predictions.

Note: Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed and the dataset available for the project to work correctly.
